# Traffic

An AI that uses Tensorflow to train a convolutional neural network to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph

## Background

As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs â€“ stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more

The dataset that will be used is the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs

## Files

The dataset is too large, therefore the `data` directory only contains the links to download them. After downloading, the `data` directory should be replaced by the downloaded folder, namely "gtsrb". The `traffic.py` file contains the main functions including loading data, getting model, training the model and evaluating the model

## How to Use

Make sure `Tensorflow`, `opencv-python` and `scikit-learn` are installed. If not, run the following command

`pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn`

In the `traffic` directory, run the command

`python traffic.py data model_filename`

Where `data` should be either gtsrb or gtsrb-small which are downloaded through the links in the `data` directory. `Model_filename` is an optional argument that will store the trained model to the specifiled path

## Example Output

```shell
$ python traffic.py gtsrb

- If not explicitly specified, model changes are comparing to the base model

Based on the test results, it can be concluded that the base model which only has one convolution layer, one pooling layer and a MNN performs this specific task poorly with accuracy of 0.0531. A better approach is by adding another convolution layer right after the first one and before the pooling layer which boosts the accuracy score to 0.9780. According to model 4, adding a pooling layer to the base model will not perform well. By adjusting the parameters based on model 3, the final result is maximized when modifying the pool size from 2x2 to 3x3, which scored at 0.9809
